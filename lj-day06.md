#lj-day-11  

today lecture was kind of relaxed, but the lab (bus-mall) was super intense.... i think it was the first day i saw EVERYBODY in the class struggle.... i dont mean to say it mean or rude ,but finally i dont feel alone... the people that normally get stuff seemed to struggle with this today and it makes me feel more human and less like i wanna rip my hair out. tomorrow i ssume we will be working with chart.js and im super excited, today we went over a lot of html tags about media and some css stuff that was kinda relaxing too cause i have a decent grasp on both of those things... i still struggle with the DOM and event handlers but im gonna keep on plugging away and hopefully ill get it eventually.
