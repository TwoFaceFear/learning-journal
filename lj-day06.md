#LJ code 201 - day 6  

Oh boy, where do i start....  

today i learned that i need to ask for help more often.... i hit a wall really early in the day because i felt like i had the answer to something correct and i couldnt get it to work, when asking my peers for help they told me i was doing it wrong so i attempted doing it differently, at the end of the day i was still struggling with the same issue and finally got help directly from duncan, who told me the method i was using before was just fine... by this time it was already 6pm and i was really behind. i couldnt finish my lab today and it really frusterated me.  

tomorrow i hope i will be able to fix my mistakes so i dont fall further behind.
