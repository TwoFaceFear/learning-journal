# learning journal day 18  

holy shit! its day 18!?!?!? i made it through 201! today i had a meeting with duncan. i knew id have to tell him i was really behind on my grades and was dreading it... he only had one response, he looked at me and asked if i felt i was comfortable with javascript. when i said yes he smiled and told me not to worry about it... i was so excited, the thing i had been dreading doing all week payed off in the end. im pretty sure duncan understands my situation though and i feel very blessed i have a teacher who understands me. today was great.
