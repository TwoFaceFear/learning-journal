#LJ code 201 - day 1  

today we learned things that were more in depth to the terminal, general html, general javascript and started css. i feel very comfortable with html and even with css but struggle a little bit with javascript. im struggling trying to grasp javascript syntax, i would like to make it as clean as possible, but it seems everybodys definition of clean is different.  

ive been struggling with remembering things so ive been writing notes on the things i think are hardest, but i dont want the notes to become a crutch. even though its difficult i am enjoying the class a lot and everybody in the class seems really freindly, all the staff here at code fellows is rad and i feel very comfortable when i walk in the building. not something im used to.  

im ready to keep learning and growing! :)
