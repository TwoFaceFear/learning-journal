#LJ code 201 - day 5  

Today was great during the review section of the lecture, i really enjoyed myself and really enjoy Duncan as a teacher, i often see him and the TAs stay late just to help students.
the lab today was very challenging and took me quite a while to figure out. i had to have help from several of my peers and several of the TAs. but at the end of the lab i had learned a lot.
im very greatful to have such a great group of people around me for this journey.  

thank you, whoever is reading this, for being so supportive and kind when all of us need it, you help make peoples life better and you should be very proud of yourself.
