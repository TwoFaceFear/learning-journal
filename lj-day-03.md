#LJ code 201 - day 3
Today we learned arrays, loops, if, if else, and else statements.we also learned more about git in the terminal and editing git repos. i am happy to say that by day 3 i am comfortably navigating the terminal, using html and css, and have the hang of md... but javascript proves to be difficult for me, i even had to turn in todays lab incomplete cause i ht a wall so hard. it makes me sad cause i want to learn and take notes and follow along best i can, but i am having a hard time retaining some of the information given to me.  

i hope its better tomorrow and i can catch up on some stuff i missed out on.
