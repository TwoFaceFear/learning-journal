#LJ code 201 - day 10

today i learned EVERYTHING i was missing from salmon cookies, which was really nice. i had been getting pretty angry at the assignment and it was really refreshing to go over it in class. the css challenge was really refreshing and felt like a breeze when compared to salmon cookies. i am still really enjoying myself in the course even though im really behind.
