# learning journal day 16  

Today was a breeze, we got basic functionality in a matter of a couple hours and only hit one wall all day. most everyone in my group is fairly productive... the only downside to this project is that Tim and Kyle have never played D&D and fen hasnt played since the 80s so i have to explain a lot. :) good day though and i think everyone is enjoying it.
