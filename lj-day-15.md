#Learning Journal Day 15  

I was really excited today, in class we had to present our ideas for project week for the 201 class and other students had to vote on their favorite, mine was one of the seven that was chosen so now i get to be a  team leader! the downside is i have to do a bunch of resubmits this weekend to get my grades up to par... its actually really stressing me out cause i really want to continue with this program, but dont know if ill get my grades up enough. im going to try my hardest to do it though.
